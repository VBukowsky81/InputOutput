# Input/Output Demonstration

All the basic building blocks of Enterprise applications

Hello there and welcome! 

I made this little program to demonstrate my solid understanding of how real applications work. What this program shows is the following:

1. Taking input from users
2. Storing that input into variables accordingly
3. Creating objects of Employees with that information
4. Passing that info into separate Database class and storing that info
5. Then looking up those objects in the Database according to input from user
6. Pulling those objects out of the Database entries, unpacking the objects and getting the data back, and displaying it back to user

Also, decided to OutputStream write that information out into a separate .txt file, to demonstrate I understand how to create files, and store data externally.

Etc etc

Pardon the lack of Exception handling code, I had little time to make this, this was a super quick app I built in 10 minutes. The implementing method has possible exception declaration. Also, try/catch blocks really overload the code, I wanted to keep this light, so readers have easier time. 

So please, just make sure to input info in appropriate format and please create that MyText.txt file on your C: drive, so it doesn't throw an exception.

Also, left a bit of a mess in Employee class, like unused default constructor and Setter methods. It's only to demonstrate I understand Getters/Setters, default constructor(important for JavaBeans) and importance of public access modifiers for certain things.

In summary, this can be easily transfered into a full application. Input can be taken from HTML input fields on some website or GUI input fields of a desktop application. The database can be easily made persistent using JPA/Hibernate and syncing it(passing it into) with any SQL database somewhere. In other words, it can easily can be passed into persistance.

PS. I fully intent to build a good quality application using JavaFX for GUI, good structure to code, lots of features and proper database syncing using MySQL(or some other SQL database). But I am currently focused on deeping my core skills and practicing with Enterprise platforms like Spring framework, Spring Boot, Hibernate, etc, in order to pass coding challenges and interviews.

Thank you very much for you time! And have a great day/evening.

Vic
